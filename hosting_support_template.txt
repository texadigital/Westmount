Subject: 502 Bad Gateway Error - Laravel Application Not Loading

Dear Support Team,

I'm experiencing a 502 Bad Gateway error when trying to access my Laravel application at https://associationwestmount.com/

The application works fine on another hosting provider, so this appears to be a server configuration issue.

REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS:
- PHP Version: 8.1 or higher (Laravel 12 requirement)
- Required Extensions: pdo_mysql, mbstring, openssl, tokenizer, xml, ctype, json, bcmath, fileinfo, curl
- Web Server: Apache with mod_rewrite OR Nginx with proper configuration
- File Permissions: 755 for directories, 644 for files, 755 for storage/ directory

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Error: 502 Bad Gateway
- Server: nginx/1.28.0
- Application: Laravel 12.26.2

PLEASE CHECK:
1. PHP-FPM service status
2. PHP version (must be 8.1+)
3. Required PHP extensions are installed
4. File permissions are correct
5. Nginx configuration for Laravel

I have uploaded diagnostic scripts to help identify the issue:
- https://associationwestmount.com/simple_test.php (basic PHP test)
- https://associationwestmount.com/hosting_diagnostic.php (detailed diagnostic)

Please run the diagnostic script and let me know what needs to be fixed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
